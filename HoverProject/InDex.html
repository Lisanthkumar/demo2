              <p>
                Petra is filled with spectacular tombs, monuments, and houses
                that were carved into the sandstone cliffs. These elaborate
                structures were chiseled by hand out of the rose-red rocks, then
                covered with stucco and painted bright colors. Beautifully
                carved buildings and monuments are found throughout the city of
                Petra.

                The longest man-made structure on earth, stretching for more
                than 20,000 km and visible from spaceThis wall was originally
                built in the third century CE by emperor Qin Shi Huangdi, who
                had recently conquered China's warring kingdoms and wanted a
                symbol of national unity under his power, ending the Warring
                States Period from about 476–221 BCE.

                Chichen-Itza one of the most important examples of the

                on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of
                Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor, Shah
                Jahan (reigned from 1628 to 1658), to house the tomb of his
                favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.

                Christ the Redeemer statue is the largest Art Deco design ever
                built in the history of the world. The statue portrays Jesus
                with arms open, symbolizing welcome and peace. Its construction
                was proposed in 1850 by priest Pedro Mario in honor of Emperor
                Pedro II's daughter, Princess Isabel.

              <p>
                The Colosseum was the scene of thousands of hand-to-hand combats
                between gladiators, of contests between men and animals, and of
                many larger combats, including mock naval engagements. However,
                it is uncertain whether the arena was the site of the martyrdom
                of early Christians.
